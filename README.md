# Production Project
The Production Project program is for a media player production facility to keep tracking of products being produced.  With this program, employees of the production facility can input new products and store them in a collection that can be recalled by any other employees at any time.  In addition, employees can now create production reports with ease.  I created this project on my own with the help of my Object-Oriented Programming professor and teaching assistants.  The Production Project program was created as a semester long program for my Object-Oriented Programming course during my senior year at Florida Gulf Coast University.  Previously, I had worked with Java and C++ in two other programming classes.  My proficiency with Java was mediocre, as I had not worked heavily with objects in Java or C++.  Not only did this project reinforce topics covered in my OOP course, the concept of creating production records and storing them in an accessible database is relevant to my information systems and supply chain management education from the Lutgert College of Business at FGCU.

## Built With
* IntelliJ 
* Repl.it
* Oracle Academy Java Programming Textbook & Resources 

## Contributing
A substantial contribution to this program would include any additional methods of utilizing and accessing the database.  The idea of an employee being able to log into the database with a username and password would assist in bringing this program to life!

## History
The semester-long production project started as a GUI with one button that said "Hello" and didn't do anything.  As the semester progressed, we implemented more into the project based on "User Issued" assigned by the professor.  I was able to solve these problems however I liked while continuing to utilized class and OOP concepts.  
<br />In the future, I hope to add an Employee tab that stores information about the employee who is currented logged into the program and database.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized
* Databases
    * This program includes a database powered by H2.
* Polymorphism
    * The ability of an object, variable, or function to take on multiple forms.
* Encapsulation
    * Used to hide data or methods associated with an instantiated class or object.
* Recursion
    * The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly.
